API Contract Policy
===================

Nullable Reference Metadata
---------------------------

The audit releases enable C# nullable reference metadata in the library projects.
CLR signatures remain available, but callers compiling with nullable warnings
enabled should review diagnostics when upgrading. Optional inputs and valid
lookup absence are described by nullable annotations and the individual API's
XML documentation. A nullable annotation does not change runtime validation.

Each package's source compatibility impact is reviewed independently. Activating
metadata on a formerly oblivious public API is treated conservatively as a Major
migration. This does not assign one shared version number to all packages.

Keep caller-side null checks where an API can return an absent value. Do not
silence warnings globally when migrating. Refer to the package-specific
documentation for defaults, required settings and missing-key behavior.
